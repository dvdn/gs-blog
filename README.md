### Recommendations for Pull-Requests
- Your description must reference related issue (EG: "Part of #XX" or "Fixes #XX"). If an issue doesn't exist, [create one](https://github.com/johnstray/gs-blog/issues) and assign it to yourself with the relevant Milestone and Labels added.
- All files uploaded must contain a blank line at the end of the file. This is good coding practice anyway.
